                    <p>When I first met Joan it was in the most unlikely place to find love. CVS. We had both just started working there around the same time.
                        I still remember the first time I saw her walk up to the front counter and I thought she was cute. We bonded over time, but were both
                        too shy to confess our crush to one another. Eventually Joan got tired of waiting for me to ask her out on a date and she got my number
                        from the work group chat and started texting me. While we talked she eventually slipped up and said she was "kilig" and I immediately
                        looked it up on google even though she embarassingly just accidentally confessed that she liked me and didn't want me to look it up.
                        Since I was now certain she felt the same way about me I finally got the courage to ask her out. Since then she has been my partner in crime
                        as she likes to call me and we have been through the journey of working together, falling in love together, college together and soon 
                        we can add marriage to that list.
